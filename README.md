#DenseNet-Cifar10
---

##Description
Train the DenseNet-40-10 on Cifar-10 dataset with data augmentation.


##Test Environments
* Keras 2.0.5
* Tensorflow 1.2.0 backend
* 2 Nvidia TitanX GPU

##Reference
The implementation of DenseNet is based on [titu1994/DenseNet](https://github.com/titu1994/DenseNet). I've made some modifications so as to make it consistent with Keras2 interface.
